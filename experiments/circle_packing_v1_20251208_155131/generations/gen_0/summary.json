Included scipy optimization despite failure because the framework is sound and fixable. Added genetic algorithm for algorithmic diversity and global search capability. This gives us a mix of: greedy construction (trial_0_5), local search (trial_0_13), structured placement (trial_0_3), continuous optimization (trial_0_2), and population-based search (trial_0_7).",
