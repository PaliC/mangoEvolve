Trial_1_9's iterative growth provides a strong alternative approach. Trial_1_2 shows successful strategy hybridization worth refining. Trial_1_8 offers algorithmic diversity with its two-phase Voronoi approach. These four trials give us: (1) a top performer to refine further, (2) a physical simulation approach, (3) a hybrid strategy, and (4) a geometric partitioning method - providing both performance and diversity for generation 2.",
