LINEAGE MAP
------------------------------------------------------------

## Generation 0 Selections

- trial_0_2 (2.6206) [performance]
  Reasoning: Highest score (2.6206) using a hexagonal initialization combined with a 'gravity' force and constrained optimization. This is very close to the benchmark.

- trial_0_14 (2.5828) [performance]
  Reasoning: Strong performance (2.5828) using a perturbed grid approach. It offers a slightly different geometric starting point than trial_0_2.

- trial_0_12 (2.5571) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a force-directed/physics-based growth model. While the score (2.5571) is lower, this approach often explores the configuration space differently than pure gradient-based optimizers.

- trial_0_4 (2.5609) [potential]
  Reasoning: Combines structured dense packing with greedy local search. This hybrid approach has potential for refinement in how it fills gaps.

## Generation 1 Selections

- trial_1_3 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_0_14
  Reasoning: Highest score achieved so far (2.6247). It successfully improved upon the previous best by refining the grid aspect ratios and hexagonal tilts.

- trial_1_0 (2.6206) [potential]
  Parent: trial_0_2
  Reasoning: Used a multi-start local optimization with Gaussian noise. While it matched the parent score (2.6206), the framework for stochastic local search is robust for further refinement.

- trial_1_6 (2.6104) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_0_4
  Reasoning: Achieved a solid score (2.6104) using a randomized greedy order for the final circles. This approach helps in exploring configurations that rigid grids might miss.

- trial_1_13 (2.5961) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a 'concentric' packing/greedy-filling logic. Although the score (2.5961) is lower, this structural alternative to hexagonal grids is worth keeping for diversity.

## Generation 2 Selections

- trial_2_6 (2.6323) [performance]
  Reasoning: Significant jump in score (2.6323), very close to the benchmark. The 'Growth and Pruning' strategy successfully found a superior configuration by starting with more circles and eliminating the least efficient ones.

- trial_2_0 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_1_3
  Reasoning: Maintains the strong baseline (2.6247) from the previous generation's best. It serves as a reliable fallback for grid-based refinements.

- trial_2_11 (2.6159) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a recursive subdivision strategy. While the score is lower (2.6159), the topology generated by bisection is fundamentally different from hexagonal grids and could be a fruitful path for further optimization.

- trial_2_4 (2.6146) [potential]
  Parent: trial_1_6
  Reasoning: Combines grid optimization with randomized greedy filling. This hybrid approach is useful for exploring non-symmetrical configurations that might break the 2.632 plateau.

### Active Approaches
- Growth and Pruning (trial_2_6): Breakthrough approach (2.6323). Starting with 30-35 circles and pruning the 'weakest' leads to much better space utilization than starting with 26.
- Recursive Bisection (trial_2_11): Interesting topological alternative (2.6159), creates non-grid structures.
- Grid/Aspect-Ratio (trial_1_3/2_0): Solid baseline (2.6247).

### Key Insights
- Starting with an over-saturated state (more than 26 circles) and then pruning allows the optimizer to "choose" which circles form the most efficient backbone. This is significantly more effective than optimizing a fixed 26-circle grid.
- We are now very close to the benchmark (2.6323 vs 2.6359). The remaining gains likely come from very fine-tuned local adjustments or finding the exact right pruning sequence.

### To Try Next
- Multi-Pruning: Run the 'Growth and Pruning' algorithm multiple times with different initial counts (30, 32, 35, 40) and different pruning criteria (smallest radius vs lowest contribution to total sum).
- Targeted Local Search on trial_2_6: Use the best result as a seed for basin-hopping or CMA-ES.
- "Jiggle and Regrow": Take trial_2_6, remove the 2 smallest circles, and try to place them elsewhere before re-optimizing.
