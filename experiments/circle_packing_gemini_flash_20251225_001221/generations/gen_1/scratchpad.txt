LINEAGE MAP

## Generation 0 Selections

- trial_0_2 (2.6206) [performance]
  Reasoning: Highest score (2.6206) using a hexagonal initialization combined with a 'gravity' force and constrained optimization. This is very close to the benchmark.

- trial_0_14 (2.5828) [performance]
  Reasoning: Strong performance (2.5828) using a perturbed grid approach. It offers a slightly different geometric starting point than trial_0_2.

- trial_0_12 (2.5571) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a force-directed/physics-based growth model. While the score (2.5571) is lower, this approach often explores the configuration space differently than pure gradient-based optimizers.

- trial_0_4 (2.5609) [potential]
  Reasoning: Combines structured dense packing with greedy local search. This hybrid approach has potential for refinement in how it fills gaps.

### Active Approaches
- Hexagonal/Gravity Hybrid (trial_0_2): Currently best (2.6206). Uses hexagonal init + gravity + optimization.
- Perturbed Grid (trial_0_14): Strong (2.5828). Good alternative geometric starting point.
- Force-Directed (trial_0_12): Diverse approach (2.5571). Good for escaping local minima of grid structures.
- Structured-Greedy Hybrid (trial_0_4): Potential for gap-filling.

### Key Insights
- Hexagonal initialization is much stronger than random or simple square grids.
- "Gravity" or "Repulsion" steps before final optimization help resolve initial overlaps and pack the boundaries.
- The top score (2.6206) is very close to the benchmark (2.636), suggesting we are in the right neighborhood.

### To Try Next
- Iterative refinement: Take the best solution (trial_0_2) and apply multiple optimization passes with small perturbations.
- Basin-hopping on top of the best configurations.
- Swapping circle positions in the best configuration to see if a better local optimum exists.
- Jittering the hexagonal grid parameters (angle, aspect ratio) before optimization.
