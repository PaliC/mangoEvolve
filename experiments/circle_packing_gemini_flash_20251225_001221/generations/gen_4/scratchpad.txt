LINEAGE MAP
------------------------------------------------------------

## Generation 0 Selections

- trial_0_2 (2.6206) [performance]
  Reasoning: Highest score (2.6206) using a hexagonal initialization combined with a 'gravity' force and constrained optimization. This is very close to the benchmark.

- trial_0_14 (2.5828) [performance]
  Reasoning: Strong performance (2.5828) using a perturbed grid approach. It offers a slightly different geometric starting point than trial_0_2.

- trial_0_12 (2.5571) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a force-directed/physics-based growth model. While the score (2.5571) is lower, this approach often explores the configuration space differently than pure gradient-based optimizers.

- trial_0_4 (2.5609) [potential]
  Reasoning: Combines structured dense packing with greedy local search. This hybrid approach has potential for refinement in how it fills gaps.

## Generation 1 Selections

- trial_1_3 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_0_14
  Reasoning: Highest score achieved so far (2.6247). It successfully improved upon the previous best by refining the grid aspect ratios and hexagonal tilts.

- trial_1_0 (2.6206) [potential]
  Parent: trial_0_2
  Reasoning: Used a multi-start local optimization with Gaussian noise. While it matched the parent score (2.6206), the framework for stochastic local search is robust for further refinement.

- trial_1_6 (2.6104) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_0_4
  Reasoning: Achieved a solid score (2.6104) using a randomized greedy order for the final circles. This approach helps in exploring configurations that rigid grids might miss.

- trial_1_13 (2.5961) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a 'concentric' packing/greedy-filling logic. Although the score (2.5961) is lower, this structural alternative to hexagonal grids is worth keeping for diversity.

## Generation 2 Selections

- trial_2_6 (2.6323) [performance]
  Reasoning: Significant jump in score (2.6323), very close to the benchmark. The 'Growth and Pruning' strategy successfully found a superior configuration by starting with more circles and eliminating the least efficient ones.

- trial_2_0 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_1_3
  Reasoning: Maintains the strong baseline (2.6247) from the previous generation's best. It serves as a reliable fallback for grid-based refinements.

- trial_2_11 (2.6159) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a recursive subdivision strategy. While the score is lower (2.6159), the topology generated by bisection is fundamentally different from hexagonal grids and could be a fruitful path for further optimization.

- trial_2_4 (2.6146) [potential]
  Parent: trial_1_6
  Reasoning: Combines grid optimization with randomized greedy filling. This hybrid approach is useful for exploring non-symmetrical configurations that might break the 2.632 plateau.

## Generation 3 Selections

- trial_3_0 (2.6323) [performance]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Maintains the current best score (2.6323). This trial implemented a simulated annealing refinement on the growth-and-pruning backbone, which is a robust framework for squeezing out more performance.

- trial_3_1 (2.6288) [potential]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Explored varying the initial circle count and pruning criteria (Voronoi area). While slightly lower in this run, this methodological diversity is key to breaking the 2.632 plateau.

- trial_3_13 (2.6109) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Implemented an 'Iterative Deepening' pruning strategy. Although the score is 2.6109, the logic of exploring the 'path' to 26 circles is a novel way to search the configuration space.

- trial_3_7 (2.5979) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a hybrid tiling approach (hexagonal and square lattices in different regions). This breaks symmetry and could lead to the asymmetric configurations often found in optimal packings.

### Active Approaches
- Growth and Pruning (trial_2_6/3_0): Best score (2.6323). The pruning method is the most robust way to find high-performing configurations.
- Randomized Hybrid (trial_3_6): Improved to 2.6233, showing that mixing grid logic with greedy placement is catching up.
- Topological Exploration (trial_3_13/3_7): Exploring non-grid symmetries (2.6109, 2.5979).

### Key Insights
- We have hit a plateau at 2.6323. Multiple trials in Gen 3 reached exactly this score but couldn't exceed it. This suggests a very strong local optimum or a structural limit of the current pruning logic.
- The gap to the benchmark (2.6359) is only 0.0036. This requires finding a configuration where circles can be slightly larger by being more "interlocked".
- Pruning based on "smallest radius" might be too greedy. Pruning based on "displacement needed to resolve overlap" or "Voronoi area" might be better.

### To Try Next
- "The Great Shakeup": Take the 2.6323 configuration, remove 3-4 circles, and use a much more aggressive stochastic search (Basin-Hopping or CMA-ES) to re-place them.
- Multi-Stage Pruning: Start with 45 circles. Prune to 35, optimize heavily. Prune to 30, optimize heavily. Prune to 26.
- Boundary-Constrained Optimization: Identify circles touching the edges and "lock" them to the edge (x=0, x=1, y=0, or y=1) to reduce optimizer degrees of freedom.
