LINEAGE MAP
------------------------------------------------------------

## Generation 0 Selections

- trial_0_2 (2.6206) [performance]
  Reasoning: Highest score (2.6206) using a hexagonal initialization combined with a 'gravity' force and constrained optimization. This is very close to the benchmark.

- trial_0_14 (2.5828) [performance]
  Reasoning: Strong performance (2.5828) using a perturbed grid approach. It offers a slightly different geometric starting point than trial_0_2.

- trial_0_12 (2.5571) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a force-directed/physics-based growth model. While the score (2.5571) is lower, this approach often explores the configuration space differently than pure gradient-based optimizers.

- trial_0_4 (2.5609) [potential]
  Reasoning: Combines structured dense packing with greedy local search. This hybrid approach has potential for refinement in how it fills gaps.

## Generation 1 Selections

- trial_1_3 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_0_14
  Reasoning: Highest score achieved so far (2.6247). It successfully improved upon the previous best by refining the grid aspect ratios and hexagonal tilts.

- trial_1_0 (2.6206) [potential]
  Parent: trial_0_2
  Reasoning: Used a multi-start local optimization with Gaussian noise. While it matched the parent score (2.6206), the framework for stochastic local search is robust for further refinement.

- trial_1_6 (2.6104) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_0_4
  Reasoning: Achieved a solid score (2.6104) using a randomized greedy order for the final circles. This approach helps in exploring configurations that rigid grids might miss.

- trial_1_13 (2.5961) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a 'concentric' packing/greedy-filling logic. Although the score (2.5961) is lower, this structural alternative to hexagonal grids is worth keeping for diversity.

## Generation 2 Selections

- trial_2_6 (2.6323) [performance]
  Reasoning: Significant jump in score (2.6323), very close to the benchmark. The 'Growth and Pruning' strategy successfully found a superior configuration by starting with more circles and eliminating the least efficient ones.

- trial_2_0 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_1_3
  Reasoning: Maintains the strong baseline (2.6247) from the previous generation's best. It serves as a reliable fallback for grid-based refinements.

- trial_2_11 (2.6159) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a recursive subdivision strategy. While the score is lower (2.6159), the topology generated by bisection is fundamentally different from hexagonal grids and could be a fruitful path for further optimization.

- trial_2_4 (2.6146) [potential]
  Parent: trial_1_6
  Reasoning: Combines grid optimization with randomized greedy filling. This hybrid approach is useful for exploring non-symmetrical configurations that might break the 2.632 plateau.

## Generation 3 Selections

- trial_3_0 (2.6323) [performance]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Maintains the current best score (2.6323). This trial implemented a simulated annealing refinement on the growth-and-pruning backbone, which is a robust framework for squeezing out more performance.

- trial_3_1 (2.6288) [potential]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Explored varying the initial circle count and pruning criteria (Voronoi area). While slightly lower in this run, this methodological diversity is key to breaking the 2.632 plateau.

- trial_3_13 (2.6109) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Implemented an 'Iterative Deepening' pruning strategy. Although the score is 2.6109, the logic of exploring the 'path' to 26 circles is a novel way to search the configuration space.

- trial_3_7 (2.5979) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a hybrid tiling approach (hexagonal and square lattices in different regions). This breaks symmetry and could lead to the asymmetric configurations often found in optimal packings.

## Generation 4 Selections

- trial_4_6 (2.6323) [performance]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Maintains the 2.6323 score using a 'Jiggle and Regrow' strategy. This approach is specifically designed to break local optima by removing and re-inserting circles, which is exactly what we need to move past the current plateau.

- trial_4_2 (2.6323) [potential]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Uses a 'Successive Relaxation' (penalty method) approach. This is a powerful optimization technique that allows the system to explore 'invalid' states to find better 'valid' ones, potentially discovering the 2.6359 configuration.

- trial_4_1 (2.6304) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Implemented Voronoi-area based pruning. While the score (2.6304) is slightly lower than the best, the logic is sound and provides a more geometric basis for pruning than simple radius size.

- trial_4_13 (2.5950) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses Sobol sequences for high-dimensional quasi-random initialization. This provides a very different set of starting points compared to the grid-based or growth-based methods used so far.

## Generation 5 Selections

- trial_5_14 (2.6323) [performance]
  Parent: trial_4_2
  Reasoning: Successfully implemented an Iterative Local Search (ILS) that maintains the 2.6323 score. The 'Perturb and Optimize' cycle is the most promising way to break the current plateau by forcing the configuration out of the local optimum.

- trial_5_4 (2.6323) [potential]
  Parent: trial_4_6
  Reasoning: Implemented a Coordinate Descent approach. By optimizing one circle at a time, it can navigate the complex constraint surface differently than the simultaneous SLSQP, potentially finding small gaps for expansion.

- trial_5_1 (2.6323) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_4_2
  Reasoning: Used 'Symmetry Breaking' via shear transformations. This is a clever way to distort the rigid grid-like structures that seem to be trapping the optimizer at 2.6323.

- trial_5_10 (2.5766) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a density-weighted Voronoi initialization. While the score is lower (2.5766), the methodology of favoring corners and edges is a known characteristic of optimal packings and provides a fresh starting point.

### Active Approaches
- Iterative Local Search (trial_5_14): "Perturb and Optimize" cycle using the 2.6323 state as a base.
- Coordinate Descent (trial_5_4): Individual circle optimization to find local 'slop' in the packing.
- Shear/Symmetry Breaking (trial_5_1): Distorting the grid to escape the 2.6323 deep local minimum.

### Key Insights
- We are in a "local optimum trap". 2.6323 is likely a very stable 5x5+1 or 4x6+2 configuration. 
- The benchmark 2.6359 suggests a configuration where circles are slightly more "interlocked" or "staggered" (hexagonal-dominant).
- To improve, we need to either: 
  1. Find a better global topology (via growth/pruning from higher N).
  2. Force the 2.6323 state to "melt" and "re-crystallize" into a better pattern.

### To Try Next
- "Metropolis-Hastings Radius Swap": Randomly pick two circles, make one significantly larger and the other smaller, then let the optimizer resolve the overlap.
- "Thermal Expansion": Start with circles having a minimum radius and gradually increase the 'required' radius while using a penalty method for overlaps.
- "Large-Scale Growth/Pruning": Start with 60+ circles to allow for much more complex initial interactions before pruning to 26.
