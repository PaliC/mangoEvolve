LINEAGE MAP
------------------------------------------------------------

## Generation 0 Selections

- trial_0_2 (2.6206) [performance]
  Reasoning: Highest score (2.6206) using a hexagonal initialization combined with a 'gravity' force and constrained optimization. This is very close to the benchmark.

- trial_0_14 (2.5828) [performance]
  Reasoning: Strong performance (2.5828) using a perturbed grid approach. It offers a slightly different geometric starting point than trial_0_2.

- trial_0_12 (2.5571) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a force-directed/physics-based growth model. While the score (2.5571) is lower, this approach often explores the configuration space differently than pure gradient-based optimizers.

- trial_0_4 (2.5609) [potential]
  Reasoning: Combines structured dense packing with greedy local search. This hybrid approach has potential for refinement in how it fills gaps.

## Generation 1 Selections

- trial_1_3 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_0_14
  Reasoning: Highest score achieved so far (2.6247). It successfully improved upon the previous best by refining the grid aspect ratios and hexagonal tilts.

- trial_1_0 (2.6206) [potential]
  Parent: trial_0_2
  Reasoning: Used a multi-start local optimization with Gaussian noise. While it matched the parent score (2.6206), the framework for stochastic local search is robust for further refinement.

- trial_1_6 (2.6104) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_0_4
  Reasoning: Achieved a solid score (2.6104) using a randomized greedy order for the final circles. This approach helps in exploring configurations that rigid grids might miss.

- trial_1_13 (2.5961) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a 'concentric' packing/greedy-filling logic. Although the score (2.5961) is lower, this structural alternative to hexagonal grids is worth keeping for diversity.

## Generation 2 Selections

- trial_2_6 (2.6323) [performance]
  Reasoning: Significant jump in score (2.6323), very close to the benchmark. The 'Growth and Pruning' strategy successfully found a superior configuration by starting with more circles and eliminating the least efficient ones.

- trial_2_0 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_1_3
  Reasoning: Maintains the strong baseline (2.6247) from the previous generation's best. It serves as a reliable fallback for grid-based refinements.

- trial_2_11 (2.6159) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a recursive subdivision strategy. While the score is lower (2.6159), the topology generated by bisection is fundamentally different from hexagonal grids and could be a fruitful path for further optimization.

- trial_2_4 (2.6146) [potential]
  Parent: trial_1_6
  Reasoning: Combines grid optimization with randomized greedy filling. This hybrid approach is useful for exploring non-symmetrical configurations that might break the 2.632 plateau.

## Generation 3 Selections

- trial_3_0 (2.6323) [performance]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Maintains the current best score (2.6323). This trial implemented a simulated annealing refinement on the growth-and-pruning backbone, which is a robust framework for squeezing out more performance.

- trial_3_1 (2.6288) [potential]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Explored varying the initial circle count and pruning criteria (Voronoi area). While slightly lower in this run, this methodological diversity is key to breaking the 2.632 plateau.

- trial_3_13 (2.6109) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Implemented an 'Iterative Deepening' pruning strategy. Although the score is 2.6109, the logic of exploring the 'path' to 26 circles is a novel way to search the configuration space.

- trial_3_7 (2.5979) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a hybrid tiling approach (hexagonal and square lattices in different regions). This breaks symmetry and could lead to the asymmetric configurations often found in optimal packings.

## Generation 4 Selections

- trial_4_6 (2.6323) [performance]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Maintains the 2.6323 score using a 'Jiggle and Regrow' strategy. This approach is specifically designed to break local optima by removing and re-inserting circles, which is exactly what we need to move past the current plateau.

- trial_4_2 (2.6323) [potential]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Uses a 'Successive Relaxation' (penalty method) approach. This is a powerful optimization technique that allows the system to explore 'invalid' states to find better 'valid' ones, potentially discovering the 2.6359 configuration.

- trial_4_1 (2.6304) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_2_6
  Reasoning: Implemented Voronoi-area based pruning. While the score (2.6304) is slightly lower than the best, the logic is sound and provides a more geometric basis for pruning than simple radius size.

- trial_4_13 (2.5950) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses Sobol sequences for high-dimensional quasi-random initialization. This provides a very different set of starting points compared to the grid-based or growth-based methods used so far.

### Active Approaches
- Jiggle and Regrow (trial_4_6): Still at 2.6323. Targeted removal of small circles to allow larger ones to expand.
- Successive Relaxation (trial_4_2): Using penalty methods to slide circles past each other.
- Voronoi Pruning (trial_4_1): A more geometric approach to selection (2.6304).

### Key Insights
- The 2.6323 score is extremely 'sticky'. This likely corresponds to a specific 26-circle configuration (perhaps a 5x5 grid + 1 or a specific hexagonal variant) that is a very deep local minimum.
- To reach 2.6359, we need a 'phase transition' in the layout. Simple hill-climbing on the 2.6323 state is failing.
- High-precision optimization (tight tolerances) is necessary but only after a structural breakthrough.

### To Try Next
- "Symmetry Breaking": Explicitly perturb the 2.6323 configuration by shifting rows or columns in opposite directions before re-optimizing.
- "The 27th Circle": Add a 27th circle into the best 26-circle packing, let the optimizer resolve overlaps via a penalty method, and then prune the one that results in the highest sum for the remaining 26.
- Basin-Hopping with Larger Steps: The current perturbations might be too small to escape the 2.6323 basin.
