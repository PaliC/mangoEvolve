LINEAGE MAP

## Generation 0 Selections

- trial_0_2 (2.6206) [performance]
  Reasoning: Highest score (2.6206) using a hexagonal initialization combined with a 'gravity' force and constrained optimization. This is very close to the benchmark.

- trial_0_14 (2.5828) [performance]
  Reasoning: Strong performance (2.5828) using a perturbed grid approach. It offers a slightly different geometric starting point than trial_0_2.

- trial_0_12 (2.5571) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a force-directed/physics-based growth model. While the score (2.5571) is lower, this approach often explores the configuration space differently than pure gradient-based optimizers.

- trial_0_4 (2.5609) [potential]
  Reasoning: Combines structured dense packing with greedy local search. This hybrid approach has potential for refinement in how it fills gaps.

## Generation 1 Selections

- trial_1_3 (2.6247) [performance]
  Parent: trial_0_14
  Reasoning: Highest score achieved so far (2.6247). It successfully improved upon the previous best by refining the grid aspect ratios and hexagonal tilts.

- trial_1_0 (2.6206) [potential]
  Parent: trial_0_2
  Reasoning: Used a multi-start local optimization with Gaussian noise. While it matched the parent score (2.6206), the framework for stochastic local search is robust for further refinement.

- trial_1_6 (2.6104) [diversity]
  Parent: trial_0_4
  Reasoning: Achieved a solid score (2.6104) using a randomized greedy order for the final circles. This approach helps in exploring configurations that rigid grids might miss.

- trial_1_13 (2.5961) [diversity]
  Reasoning: Uses a 'concentric' packing/greedy-filling logic. Although the score (2.5961) is lower, this structural alternative to hexagonal grids is worth keeping for diversity.

### Active Approaches
- Grid/Aspect-Ratio Optimization (trial_1_3): Currently best (2.6247). Showed that adjusting the grid's stretch/tilt before optimization is key.
- Stochastic Multi-start (trial_1_0): Framework for noise-based refinement.
- Randomized Greedy (trial_1_6): Good for breaking grid symmetries (2.6104).
- Concentric/Filling (trial_1_13): Alternative topology (2.5961).

### Key Insights
- Small adjustments to the initial grid (aspect ratio, number of columns/rows) yield significant score improvements. 26 circles don't fit perfectly in a 5x5 or 6x5, so the "extra" circles or gaps need specific handling.
- Most trials are hitting a plateau around 2.620. To reach 2.636, we need to allow circles to have significantly different radii (some large, some small) rather than a uniform-ish expansion.

### To Try Next
- Targeted Jittering: Instead of global noise, apply jitter only to the circles with the smallest radii in the best solution.
- "Swap and Squeeze": Swap a large circle with a small one in the configuration and re-optimize.
- Successive Relaxation: Optimize with a lower bound on radii, then slowly lower that bound to let the optimizer find asymmetric solutions.
- Basin-hopping with a custom 'step' that moves circles to the largest available gaps.
