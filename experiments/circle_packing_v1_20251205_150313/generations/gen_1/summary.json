Included two diverse approaches (random+local optimization and simulated annealing) that use fundamentally different search strategies. Generation 1 had many failures due to code structure issues (missing run_packing/construct_packing functions), but the one successful trial showed significant improvement. For generation 2, we should focus on: (1) further refining the winning approach from trial_1_0, (2) fixing the function definition errors that plagued generation 1, and (3) exploring hybrid approaches that combine multiple successful strategies.",
