The remaining 17 trials failed due to boundary violations, overlaps, or implementation issues - these failures suggest the constraint handling needs improvement in new generations. Focus should be on: (1) refining trial_1_2's approach to push past the benchmark, (2) combining best practices from trial_1_1 and trial_1_0, and (3) ensuring all new trials properly handle boundary constraints and overlap detection.",
