Generation 6 Analysis:
- Trial 6_4 achieved 2.6360, surpassing the goal of 2.635.
- The success came from 'melting' a top-tier configuration (3_6) using a fluid/Brownian motion approach and then re-solidifying it with high-precision optimization.
- This suggests that the 2.63+ territory is highly sensitive to the exact topological arrangement of the 'rattlers' (circles not fully constrained).

Strategy for Gen 7 (Final Push):
- We will use 6_4 as the new gold standard.
- We will attempt to 'polish' 6_4 using even higher precision and targeted 'surgical' adjustments.
- We will also explore if the 'Boundary-Constrained' logic from 6_6 can be applied to the 6_4 configuration to eke out 2.637+.
