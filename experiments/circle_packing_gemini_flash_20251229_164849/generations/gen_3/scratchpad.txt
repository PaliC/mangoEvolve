Generation 2 Insights:
- Best Score: 2.6255 (Trial 2_4). The gap to 2.635 is now only 0.0095.
- Successful Strategies: 'Growth' simulations (2_4) and 'Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation' (2_2) are significantly outperforming simple grids.
- Penalty-based SLSQP remains the best local refiner.
- The 'Growth' method (2_4) effectively acts as a global-to-local transition, which is ideal for this geometry.

Strategy for Gen 3:
- Refine the 'Growth' simulation in 2_4: use a slower growth rate and more 'force-directed' steps to allow the packing to settle more naturally.
- Hybridize CVT (2_2) with the 'Growth' method: use CVT to place the initial small seeds before starting the growth simulation.
- Increase the multi-start count for CVT-based runs.
- In the penalty method, experiment with 'radius-specific' weights—perhaps allowing smaller circles to be more 'compressible' during the early stages of optimization.
