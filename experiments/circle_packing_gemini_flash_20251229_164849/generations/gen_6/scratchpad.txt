Generation 5 Insights:
- Best Score: 2.6299 (Trial 3_6).
- We are consistently hitting a wall at ~2.630. This suggests the optimal packing is not a simple variation of the current layouts.
- Thermal Annealing (5_1) is stable but needs more iterations or 'cycles' to find deeper minima.
- Radius-Biased optimization (5_4) helps distribute space more fairly, which is crucial for maximizing a sum (rather than max-min).

Strategy for Gen 6:
- 'Shake and Bake': Apply significant noise to the 3_6 configuration, then 'bake' it using a radius-biased SLSQP solver.
- 'Dual Voronoi Relocation': Move the two smallest circles in the best packing to the two largest empty Voronoi regions simultaneously.
- 'Cyclic Cooling': Run multiple rounds of [Noise -> Biased Optimization -> High-Precision Refinement] on the best known configuration.
- 'Inflationary Growth': Start with best centers, set radii to near-zero, and 'inflate' them using a penalty-based solver that prioritizes the smallest circles.
