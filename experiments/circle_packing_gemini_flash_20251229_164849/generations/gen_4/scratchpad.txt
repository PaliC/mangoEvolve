Generation 3 Insights:
- Best Score: 2.6299 (Trial 3_6). We are within 0.0051 of the 2.635 target.
- 'Circle Jiggling' (3_6) is a breakthrough for local refinement.
- CVT (3_2) and Growth (3_0) are the dominant initialization strategies.
- The objective for 26 circles is likely a 'mixed' packing where many circles are equal size but a few small ones fill gaps.

Strategy for Gen 4:
- Apply 'Iterative Jiggling' from 3_6 to the best configurations from 3_2 and 3_0.
- Introduce a 'Simulated Annealing' schedule to the jiggling noise to allow for larger structural jumps early and fine stabilization late.
- Experiment with 'Circle Deletion and Regrowth': remove the smallest circle from a 2.629+ packing and use a growth simulation to see if it can be replaced by a larger one or if the extra space allows others to expand.
- Use a 'Soft-Body' physics phase where circles can overlap significantly with a quadratic penalty before hardening into the final SLSQP optimization.
