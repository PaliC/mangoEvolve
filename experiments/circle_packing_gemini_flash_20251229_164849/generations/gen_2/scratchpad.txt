Generation 1 Insights:
- Best Score: 2.6211 (Trial 1_7).
- Penalty/Barrier methods (Trial 1_7) allow circles to 'slide' during optimization, which is superior to hard constraints from the start.
- Multi-start strategies (Trial 1_0) are effective but need more diverse seeds.
- The 2.635 target likely requires an asymmetric, non-grid-like configuration.

Strategy for Gen 2:
- Hybridize Trial 1_7's penalty method with more sophisticated global search seeds.
- Use 'Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation' (CVT) and staggered hexagonal grids as seeds.
- Implement a 'Perturb and Squeeze' loop: take a valid packing, apply a large random displacement to a few circles, and re-optimize with the penalty method.
- Refine the objective function to slightly favor uniform radii initially to prevent one circle from 'dominating' early and blocking others.
