Generation 0 Insights:
- Trial 0_3 reached 2.6160 using a two-stage approach: first maximizing a uniform radius 'r', then relaxing to maximize the sum. This is a very strong baseline.
- Trial 0_0 showed that a 5x5 grid + 1 extra circle is a competitive starting point (2.5992).
- Force-directed methods (0_8) and greedy geometric methods (0_2) are currently underperforming but provide structural diversity.
- Common failure modes: Negative radii and overlapping circles due to poor constraint handling in the local optimizer (SLSQP).

Strategy for Gen 1:
- Refine the two-stage approach from 0_3 by introducing multi-start or jittering.
- Hybridize the grid approach with better 'gap-filling' for the 26th circle.
- Improve the robustness of the force-directed approach to ensure non-negativity and better convergence.
