Generation 4 Insights:
- Best Score: 2.6299 (Trial 3_6) remains the benchmark. Gen 4 reached 2.6207.
- The 'jiggling' refinement is powerful but may be plateauing; we need more 'surgical' or 'structural' changes.
- Smart Basin Hopping (4_7) that targets specific circles (like the smallest ones) for relocation is a promising way to break local optima.
- 'Fluid Growth' (4_3) helps in finding more 'natural' packings that aren't biased by initial grid/CVT placements.

Strategy for Gen 5:
- Perform 'Surgical Jiggling' on 3_6: instead of all-at-once noise, target the 'weakest' circles (smallest/most room) for perturbation.
- Implement 'Radius-Biased' optimization: weight smaller circles more heavily in the objective function initially to force them to 'claim' space.
- Use 'Ghost Circle' replacement: remove the smallest circle, add two tiny ones in the largest gaps, and see if the resulting 27-circle optimization allows for a better 26-circle subset.
- Hybridize the 'Fluid Growth' (4_3) with the high-quality 3_6 configuration by 'melting' it slightly and re-freezing.
