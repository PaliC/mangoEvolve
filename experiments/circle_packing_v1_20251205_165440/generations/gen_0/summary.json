Added trial_0_5 (genetic algorithm) and trial_0_14 (basin-hopping) for algorithmic diversity, as they use fundamentally different search strategies. Included trial_0_1 (greedy) for its potential - while currently underperforming, greedy algorithms are computationally efficient and could serve as excellent initializers for optimization methods or be improved with better heuristics. This selection balances exploitation of high-performing optimization methods with exploration of diverse algorithmic paradigms.",
