Generation 1 Insights:
- Best Score: 2.6303 (trial_1_0), using a multi-jittered hexagonal lattice initialization.
- The gap to the target (2.63598) is now less than 0.006.
- Hexagonal starts are strong, but grid-rattling (trial_1_5) and basin-hopping (trial_1_1) provide valuable alternative topologies.
- Precision and 'safety epsilons' are critical as the packing becomes extremely tight.
Generation 2 Strategy:
- Intensify local search around trial_1_0 using more iterations and smaller tolerances.
- Implement 'Iterated Local Search' (ILS): take trial_1_0, apply a 'kick' (move 1-2 circles), and re-optimize.
- Use the best Gen 1 results as seeds for Basin-hopping with very small step sizes.
- Explore 'Polishing' techniques: maximizing min(r) first to balance the packing, then maximizing sum(r).
