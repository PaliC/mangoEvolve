Generation 2 Insights:
- High Score remains 2.6303 (trial_1_0). Gen 2 attempts (trial_2_10, trial_2_5) reached 2.629, indicating we are hitting a plateau in the current basins.
- The gap to the target (2.63598) is roughly 0.0056.
- High-precision refinement is necessary. Simple 'kicking' might be too disruptive; we need 'surgical' perturbations.
- The 'Max-Min then Max-Sum' strategy (trial_2_3) is promising for balancing the packing before the final push.
Generation 3 Strategy:
- Focus heavily on trial_1_0 as the primary seed.
- Implement 'Surgical Re-insertion': Remove the smallest circle in trial_1_0 and find the optimal hole for it using a high-resolution grid search.
- Use 'Thermal Polishing': Apply very small, decaying noise to trial_1_0's centers (simulated annealing) with frequent SLSQP 'snaps'.
- Multi-objective: Optimize trial_1_0 using a weighted sum of radii to favor the growth of smaller circles, which might be 'trapped'.
