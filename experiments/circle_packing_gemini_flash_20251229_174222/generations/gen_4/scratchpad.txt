Generation 3 Insights:
- High Score still 2.6303 (trial_1_0). Most refinements (trial_3_10) reached 2.627-2.629, suggesting the current local basin is well-explored.
- The gap to the target (2.63598) is roughly 0.0056.
- Many failures in Gen 3 were due to tiny boundary/overlap violations (1e-6 range). This highlights the need for a 'safety buffer' (e.g., 1e-9) in constraints.
- Strategy for Gen 4: Move from 'shaking' to 'squeezing' and 'surgical' topological changes.
Generation 4 Strategy:
- Squeezing (Over-compaction): Shrink the square to [0, 0.99]^2, optimize, then expand and refine. This forces the circles to find a tighter packing.
- Surgical Re-insertion: Systematically remove the circle with the smallest radius from trial_1_0 and re-insert it into the largest 'void' found by a high-resolution grid search.
- Micro-Jittering: Perform 500+ micro-perturbations (scale 1e-4) of trial_1_0, followed by high-precision SLSQP (ftol=1e-12).
- Log-Sum-Exp Smoothing: Use a smoothed penalty function for overlaps to allow the optimizer to 'tunnel' through infeasible regions to better topologies.
