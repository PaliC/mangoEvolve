Added grid-based (trial_0_3) and hybrid (trial_0_14) approaches for their potential to improve with refinement. Included simulated annealing (trial_0_4) for algorithmic diversity and its exploration capabilities. This selection balances proven performance with approaches that have room for improvement through parameter tuning, better initialization, or hybrid combinations.",
