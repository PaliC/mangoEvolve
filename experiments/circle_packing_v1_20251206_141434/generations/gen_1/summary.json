This gives us three high-performing optimization-based approaches (all scoring above 2.5) and one alternative strategy (alternating optimization). The focus is on proven performance while maintaining some algorithmic diversity. Many generation 1 trials had implementation errors, but the successful ones show that the optimization-based approaches are consistently reaching scores near the benchmark.",
