Also selected trial_1_4 (2.4833) for its successful two-phase approach. Included trial_1_11 for geometric diversity (square-optimized hexagonal) and trial_1_6 for its hybrid concept that could be refined. These four trials represent our best performers plus diverse approaches that can be mutated and combined in generation 2.",
