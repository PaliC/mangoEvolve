Also selected trial_2_12 for its trust-region approach diversity, and keeping trial_1_9 as a proven baseline. With only 0.0039 gap to close, we should focus next generation on fine-tuning trial_2_1's approach with even better initial configurations, tighter optimization, and possibly hybrid refinement strategies.",
