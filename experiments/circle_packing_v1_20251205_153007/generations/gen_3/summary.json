However, trial_3_2 came very close to trial_2_1's performance with adaptive radii. We're stuck at ~2.63, just 0.004 from the benchmark. The gap is extremely small - likely due to fundamental packing geometry limits or needing even more precise optimization. For generation 4, we should: (1) Fix the coordinate system bugs that plagued this generation, (2) Focus on micro-optimizations and numerical precision, (3) Try ensemble approaches that run trial_2_1 multiple times with different random seeds, (4) Consider that we may be at or very near the true optimum for this problem.",
