  "selection_reasoning": "Selected top 3 optimization-based performers (multi-start, SQP, basic scipy) for their proven strong results and refinement potential. Added two geometrically-inspired approaches (spiral, Voronoi) for diversity. All five trials scored above 2.52, showing they're in the right performance range. The multi-start optimization trial_0_13 is particularly promising at 2.6228, just 0.46% from the benchmark. Next generation should focus on: (1) refining trial_0_13 with better initialization and more starts, (2) hybridizing geometric approaches with optimization, (3) exploring constraint relaxation and sequential optimization strategies.",
