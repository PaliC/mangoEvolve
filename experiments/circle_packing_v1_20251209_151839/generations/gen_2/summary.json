  "selection_reasoning": "Generation 2 achieved a breakthrough with trial_2_5 (2.6235) becoming the new best, surpassing trial_0_13's previous record of 2.6228. We're now only 0.0115 from the AlphaEvolve benchmark of 2.635 (99.56% of target). Selected top 5 performers, all using multi-start optimization with different strategies: adaptive multi-start (trial_2_5), enhanced multi-start with 80 starts (trial_2_0), streamlined explicit radius maximization (trial_2_2), two-phase exploration+refinement (trial_2_3), and temperature-based exploration (trial_2_12). Key insights: (1) Adaptive approaches that focus effort on promising candidates work best, (2) 60-80 starts with efficient optimization (maxiter=200-300) is the sweet spot, (3) Hexagonal and boundary-focused initializations consistently perform well, (4) We're very close to the benchmark - incremental improvements through better local search and radius expansion could close the remaining 0.0115 gap. Next generation should focus on: fine-tuning trial_2_5's adaptive approach, adding more sophisticated local search, implementing aggressive post-optimization radius expansion, and exploring hybrid combinations of top approaches.",

Uses adaptive multi-start optimization that focuses computational effort on promising candidates through a three-phase approach (quick screening, medium refinement, deep optimization). Only 0.0115 from benchmark. This approach should be the primary focus for further refinement.",
