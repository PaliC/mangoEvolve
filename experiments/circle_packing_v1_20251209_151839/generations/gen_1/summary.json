All three use optimization-based approaches but with different formulations. Added trial_1_7 for diversity as it uses hierarchical divide-and-conquer strategy. Next generation should focus on: (1) faster, simpler optimizations to avoid timeouts, (2) better initialization strategies for multi-start, (3) post-optimization refinement phases, (4) hybrid approaches combining geometric intuition with gradient-based optimization. The 9 timeouts suggest we need to be more careful about computational complexity.",
