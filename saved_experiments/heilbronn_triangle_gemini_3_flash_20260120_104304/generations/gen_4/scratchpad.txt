SCRATCHPAD FOR GENERATION 4

# Strategy: Heilbronn Triangle (n=11)

## Core Constraints
- Container: Equilateral triangle (0,0), (1,0), (0.5, sqrt(3)/2).
- Area: sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.433.
- Points: 11.
- Objective: Maximize the minimum area of any triangle formed by 3 points.

## Initial Hypotheses
1. **Geometric Priors**: Optimal configurations often place points on the boundary and in a roughly hexagonal interior lattice.
2. **Robust Optimization**: Simulated Annealing (SA) and Basin-Hopping are likely to outperform standard local search due to the "rugged" nature of the min-area landscape.
3. **Targeted Perturbation**: A heuristic that specifically moves points involved in the current minimum-area triangle could accelerate convergence.
4. **Symmetry**: Exploring 3-fold rotational symmetry or reflections might yield high-performing initial seeds.

## Planned Approaches for Gen 0
- SA with geometric constraints.
- Basin-hopping using scipy's minimize.
- Differential Evolution for global search.
- Targeted "Smart Mutation" evolutionary strategy.
- Grid-based initialization with jitter.

## Generation 0 Analysis
- **Top Score**: 0.9637 (trial_0_7) - Multi-start L-BFGS-B with a smoothed objective (log-sum-exp).
- **Runner Up**: 0.9008 (trial_0_6) - 3-fold symmetry optimization. This is a very strong result for a constrained search space.
- **Third**: 0.8929 (trial_0_11) - CMA-ES.
- **Observation**: Smoothed objectives (like log-sum-exp or soft-min) seem crucial for gradient-based solvers to handle the non-differentiable 'min' function.
- **Observation**: Symmetry (trial_0_6) is a powerful prior for this problem.

## Generation 1 Strategy
- Focus on refining the Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) smoothing technique which yielded the highest score (0.9637).
- Explore the interaction between symmetry constraints and local optimization.
- Test Basin-Hopping with SLSQP to better handle the linear boundary constraints of the triangle.
- Investigate 'annealing' the alpha parameter in the LSE objective (starting smooth and getting sharper).

## Generation 1 Analysis
- **Breakthrough**: trial_1_2 achieved 0.9964. It combined 3-fold symmetry with a Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) objective and SLSQP. 
- **Symmetry**: The symmetric starting point seems to place the optimizer in a very high-quality basin.
- **Failures**: Several trials (1_3, 1_4, 1_8, 1_10, 1_14) were INVALID. This usually means points fell outside the triangle or the array shape was wrong. 
- **Constraint Tip**: When using SLSQP, linear constraints for the triangle (x >= 0, y >= 0, x + y/sqrt(3) <= 1, etc. depending on coordinate system) must be robust.

## Generation 1 Insights
- Best score: 0.9963955590169408 (trial_1_2)
- Successful approach: 3-fold symmetry (with orbits and a center point) + SLSQP + Log-Sum-Exp.
- 11 points symmetry breakdown used in trial_1_2: 
    - 1 point at the centroid.
    - 3 orbits of 3 points each (total 10 points).
    - Wait, trial_1_2 actually defined 11 points by using a specific parameterization.
- High failure rate (INVALID) was due to points drifting outside (1e-6 tolerance) or incorrect array shapes.
- The Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) alpha parameter is sensitive; trial_1_2 used alpha=1000.

## Generation 2 Insights
- New Best Score: 0.997133 (trial_2_7).
- Trial 2_7 refined the 3-fold symmetry approach.
- Symmetry-breaking (trial_2_1, 2_0) failed due to 'INVALID' status, likely point-in-triangle constraint violations or shape mismatches.
- The gap to 1.0 is closing, but the 'min' function's non-differentiability remains the primary hurdle.

## Generation 3 Strategy
- Targeting the 1.0 score barrier.
- Primary focus: Relaxing symmetry constraints from trial trial_2_7.
- Experimenting with alpha-annealing and barycentric coordinates for better constraint handling.
- Diversifying with bilateral symmetry and boundary-constrained configurations.
## Generation 4 Insights
- **Trial 2_7** is the current SOTA (0.9971).
- **Key Success Factors**:
    1. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Optimizing 11 parameters (enforcing symmetry) before relaxing to 22.
    2. **Coordinate Mapping**: Using a transform to turn triangle constraints into box constraints [0,1].
    3. **Analytic Gradients**: Calculating exact derivatives for the Softmin objective.
    4. **Objective**: Softmin on squared area ($Area^2$) with alpha up to 100,000.
- **Symmetry Pattern**: The 11 points are likely 5 pairs (mirrored) + 1 point on the axis of symmetry.
- **Next Steps**: Refine the alpha-annealing schedule and try different starting seeds for the 11D optimization.
