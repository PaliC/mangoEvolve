For each subsequent circle, find positions tangent to:\n   - Two existing circles, or\n   - One circle and one wall, or\n   - Two walls (corner)\n3. Choose the tangent placement that maximizes the new radius\n4. Final SLSQP polish on all parameters\n\nThis exploits that optimal packings have tangent contacts.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef construct_packing():\n    pass\n\ndef run_packing():\n    return construct_packing()\n```",
