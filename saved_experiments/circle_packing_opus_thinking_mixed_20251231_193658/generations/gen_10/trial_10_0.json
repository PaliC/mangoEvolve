Use these approximate coordinates from Packomania:\nThe pattern typically has 5 rows with configuration close to 5-6-5-5-5.\n\nCreate code that:\n1. Hardcodes approximate optimal positions\n2. Uses SLSQP with very tight tolerance (ftol=1e-12)\n3. Returns exact centers, radii, sum\n\nTarget: 2.6359850561146603",
