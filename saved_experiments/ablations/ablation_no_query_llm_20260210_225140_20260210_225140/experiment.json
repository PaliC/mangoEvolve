Grid-based initialization (5x5 + 1) + SLSQP optimization.\n2. Random initialization + Basin-hopping global optimization.\n3. Force-directed / \"Growth\" simulation followed by local refinement.\n4. Multi-start SLSQP with random initial positions.\n5. Optimization where radii are explicit variables vs. derived from centers.\n6. Equal-radius packing seeds followed by radius expansion.\n\n## Generation 0 Analysis\n- Best score: 2.619210 (trial_0_4) using a two-stage approach (equal radius then variable).\n- trial_0_0 (grid + SLSQP) also performed well (2.607).\n- Failures (0_2, 0_3, 0_5) were due to:\n    - trial_0_2: 'radii' not defined/returned correctly.\n    - trial_0_3: Optimization failed to converge or returned invalid shapes.\n    - trial_0_5: trust-constr was too slow or had constraint violations.\n- Key Insight: SLSQP seems robust for this problem size. Two-stage initialization is superior to simple grid/random.\n\n## Generation 1 Strategy\n- Focused on refining trial_0_4 (two-stage optimization).\n- Introduced Basin-hopping and 'shaking' to escape local optima.\n- Diversified initializations with hexagonal grids and force-directed seeds.\n- Experimenting with greedy growth and specialized constraint handling.\n\n## Generation 1 Analysis\n- trial_1_1 (2.629): Hexagonal grid variations + SLSQP. Very effective.\n- trial_1_2 (2.624): Force-directed seeding. Good diversity.\n- trial_1_3/1_4: Failed due to boundary constraints (r > x or r > 1-x).\n- trial_1_0: Returned 0.0. Likely a logic error in the Basin-hopping implementation.\n- Insight: Boundary constraints (r <= x, r <= 1-x, etc.) must be handled carefully in SLSQP.\n- Strategy: Use trial_1_1 as the new baseline. Try to perturb its best result or use more dense hexagonal seeds.\n\n## Generation 2 Analysis\n- Best score improved to 2.629964 (trial_2_2) using refined force-directed seeding + SLSQP.\n- trial_2_5 (dense packing library approach) reached 2.628, confirming that equal-circle packings are strong seeds.\n- trial_2_0 (hexagonal multi-start) reached 2.6277.\n- LP-based approach (trial_2_1) was slightly lower (2.609) but provides a mathematically rigorous way to handle radii; it might be better as a refinement step rather than a global search tool.\n- Insight: The force-directed approach (trial_2_2) is currently the most effective at finding high-quality configurations.\n\n## Generation 3 Progress\n- Current Best: 2.6299638172389597\n- Focused on refining the force-directed (trial_2_2) and hexagonal (trial_1_1) approaches.\n- Introduced multi-start perturbations and adaptive forces.\n\n## Generation 3 Analysis\n- Progress has stalled at 2.6299638172389597. Gen 3 did not surpass trial_2_2.- Strategy: Need more aggressive exploration or structural changes. Let's try 'circle-swapping' and 'gap-filling' techniques.\n## Generation 4 Analysis\n- Progress! New best score: 2.63021480 (trial_4_1).\n- trial_4_1 used a force-directed approach with a cooling schedule. This confirms that finding the right 'topology' before local optimization is key.\n- trial_4_4 (Basin-hopping) was decent (2.626) but didn't beat the force-directed baseline.\n- trial_4_3 (LP-SLSQP) failed, likely due to a coding error in the constraint formulation or solver call.\n- Insight: The force-directed cooling schedule is the most promising path. We should refine the 'annealing' parameters and perhaps combine it with the 'circle-reinsertion' or 'jitter' ideas.\n\n## Generation 5 Analysis\n- Breakthrough! trial_5_4 achieved 2.635983, which is extremely close to the best known solution (2.635985).\n- trial_5_4 used an exponential cooling schedule with 'thermal' noise (simulated annealing style) in a force-directed model.\n- trial_5_1 also performed exceptionally well (2.635328) using an iterative LP-SLSQP approach.\n- The combination of force-directed topology search and high-precision refinement (SLSQP/LP) is clearly the winning strategy.\n- Next steps: \n    1. Fine-tune the cooling and noise parameters of 5_4.\n    2. Use the configuration from 5_4 as a seed for the LP-SLSQP method in 5_1.\n    3. Run more iterations and tighter tolerances for the final refinement.\n\n## Generation 6 Analysis\n- Best score remains ~2.635983 (trial_5_4).\n- Gen 6 trials (6_5, 6_1) reached the same neighborhood but didn't push past it.\n- The gap to the best known (2.635985) is only 0.000002.\n- This suggests the 'topology' is likely correct, and we are now in a high-precision refinement phase.\n- Strategy for Gen 7: \n    1. Focus on the 'Active Set' of constraints.\n    2. Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` with `method='trust-constr'` or `SLSQP` with analytically computed Jacobians for better convergence.\n    3. Try a 'perturb and polish' approach on the 5_4 configuration with very small epsilon.\n\n## Generation 8 Strategy\n- Current Best: 2.6359830855348263 (trial_6_5)\n- Focusing on high-precision refinement and micro-perturbations of the best known configuration.",
