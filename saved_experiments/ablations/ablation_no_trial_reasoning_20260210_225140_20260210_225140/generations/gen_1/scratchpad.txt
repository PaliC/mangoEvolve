# Initial Strategy: Circle Packing for Max Sum of Radii (N=26)

The objective is to maximize the sum of radii of 26 non-overlapping circles within a unit square.
This is slightly different from the standard packing problem (maximizing a single uniform radius).
The optimization landscape is highly non-convex with many local optima.

## Approaches to explore:
1.  **Multi-start SLSQP**: Use random initializations for (x, y, r) and optimize using Sequential Least Squares Programming.
2.  **Basin-Hopping**: Use global optimization to explore the center configurations, potentially solving for radii as a sub-problem.
3.  **Structured Initialization**: Start from grid-like (5x5 + 1) or hexagonal patterns and refine.
4.  **Sequential Addition**: Place circles one-by-one into the largest available gaps and optimize locally.
5.  **Penalty-based Optimization**: Use a soft-constraint approach (e.g., minimize overlap energy) before switching to hard constraints.
6.  **Fixed-Center Radii Optimization**: Note that for fixed centers, maximizing the sum of radii is a Linear Programming problem. This can be used to decouple the search for centers from the search for radii.

## Key Constraints:
- 0 <= x_i - r_i
- x_i + r_i <= 1
- 0 <= y_i - r_i
- y_i + r_i <= 1
- dist(c_i, c_j) >= r_i + r_j

## Generation 0 Analysis
- Best Score: 2.629914 (trial_0_0)
- trial_0_0 used multi-start SLSQP with random initialization.
- trial_0_2 used a grid-based initialization and reached 2.618.
- trial_0_1 used basin-hopping but scored lower than pure multi-start SLSQP, possibly due to fewer iterations or poor step size.
- trial_0_3 (LP approach) underperformed (2.216), likely because the center optimization wasn't aggressive enough.
- trial_0_4 failed (INVALID).

## Generation 1 Insights
- Best score: 2.632342 (trial_1_3)
- trial_1_3 used 'Iterative Local Refinement' (shaking) on top of the best Gen 0 result. This proved more effective than pure multi-start.
- trial_1_0 (multi-start with Sobol) achieved 2.628, which is slightly lower than the best Gen 0 but very robust.
- trial_1_4 (Force-Directed) reached 2.626, showing that physics-based initialization is competitive.
- The LP-based approach (trial_1_1) is still underperforming (2.612) compared to direct SLSQP on (x, y, r), likely because the center movement is restricted or the objective landscape for centers is too rugged for the global optimizer used.

## Strategy for Gen 2
- Focus on "Shaking + SLSQP": The success of trial_1_3 suggests that local search with perturbations is the way to go.
- Increase the intensity and variety of the "shaking" (e.g., swapping circles, variable perturbation sizes).
- Try combining the Force-Directed approach (trial_1_4) as an initialization for the Shaking refinement.
