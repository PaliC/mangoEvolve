# Initial Strategy: Circle Packing for Max Sum of Radii (N=26)

The objective is to maximize the sum of radii of 26 non-overlapping circles within a unit square.
This is slightly different from the standard packing problem (maximizing a single uniform radius).
The optimization landscape is highly non-convex with many local optima.

## Approaches to explore:
1.  **Multi-start SLSQP**: Use random initializations for (x, y, r) and optimize using Sequential Least Squares Programming.
2.  **Basin-Hopping**: Use global optimization to explore the center configurations, potentially solving for radii as a sub-problem.
3.  **Structured Initialization**: Start from grid-like (5x5 + 1) or hexagonal patterns and refine.
4.  **Sequential Addition**: Place circles one-by-one into the largest available gaps and optimize locally.
5.  **Penalty-based Optimization**: Use a soft-constraint approach (e.g., minimize overlap energy) before switching to hard constraints.
6.  **Fixed-Center Radii Optimization**: Note that for fixed centers, maximizing the sum of radii is a Linear Programming problem. This can be used to decouple the search for centers from the search for radii.

## Key Constraints:
- 0 <= x_i - r_i
- x_i + r_i <= 1
- 0 <= y_i - r_i
- y_i + r_i <= 1
- dist(c_i, c_j) >= r_i + r_j

## Generation 0 Analysis
- Best Score: 2.629914 (trial_0_0)
- trial_0_0 used multi-start SLSQP with random initialization.
- trial_0_2 used a grid-based initialization and reached 2.618.
- trial_0_1 used basin-hopping but scored lower than pure multi-start SLSQP, possibly due to fewer iterations or poor step size.
- trial_0_3 (LP approach) underperformed (2.216), likely because the center optimization wasn't aggressive enough.
- trial_0_4 failed (INVALID).
