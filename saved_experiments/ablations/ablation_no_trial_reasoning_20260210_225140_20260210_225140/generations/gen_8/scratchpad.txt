# Initial Strategy: Circle Packing for Max Sum of Radii (N=26)

The objective is to maximize the sum of radii of 26 non-overlapping circles within a unit square.
This is slightly different from the standard packing problem (maximizing a single uniform radius).
The optimization landscape is highly non-convex with many local optima.

## Approaches to explore:
1.  **Multi-start SLSQP**: Use random initializations for (x, y, r) and optimize using Sequential Least Squares Programming.
2.  **Basin-Hopping**: Use global optimization to explore the center configurations, potentially solving for radii as a sub-problem.
3.  **Structured Initialization**: Start from grid-like (5x5 + 1) or hexagonal patterns and refine.
4.  **Sequential Addition**: Place circles one-by-one into the largest available gaps and optimize locally.
5.  **Penalty-based Optimization**: Use a soft-constraint approach (e.g., minimize overlap energy) before switching to hard constraints.
6.  **Fixed-Center Radii Optimization**: Note that for fixed centers, maximizing the sum of radii is a Linear Programming problem. This can be used to decouple the search for centers from the search for radii.

## Key Constraints:
- 0 <= x_i - r_i
- x_i + r_i <= 1
- 0 <= y_i - r_i
- y_i + r_i <= 1
- dist(c_i, c_j) >= r_i + r_j

## Generation 0 Analysis
- Best Score: 2.629914 (trial_0_0)
- trial_0_0 used multi-start SLSQP with random initialization.
- trial_0_2 used a grid-based initialization and reached 2.618.
- trial_0_1 used basin-hopping but scored lower than pure multi-start SLSQP, possibly due to fewer iterations or poor step size.
- trial_0_3 (LP approach) underperformed (2.216), likely because the center optimization wasn't aggressive enough.
- trial_0_4 failed (INVALID).

## Generation 1 Insights
- Best score: 2.632342 (trial_1_3)
- trial_1_3 used 'Iterative Local Refinement' (shaking) on top of the best Gen 0 result. This proved more effective than pure multi-start.
- trial_1_0 (multi-start with Sobol) achieved 2.628, which is slightly lower than the best Gen 0 but very robust.
- trial_1_4 (Force-Directed) reached 2.626, showing that physics-based initialization is competitive.
- The LP-based approach (trial_1_1) is still underperforming (2.612) compared to direct SLSQP on (x, y, r), likely because the center movement is restricted or the objective landscape for centers is too rugged for the global optimizer used.

## Strategy for Gen 2
- Focus on "Shaking + SLSQP": The success of trial_1_3 suggests that local search with perturbations is the way to go.
- Increase the intensity and variety of the "shaking" (e.g., swapping circles, variable perturbation sizes).
- Try combining the Force-Directed approach (trial_1_4) as an initialization for the Shaking refinement.

## Generation 2 Analysis
- trial_2_0 (2.629) was a slight regression from trial_1_3 (2.632).
- Many Gen 2 trials failed due to implementation errors (INVALID). 
- The "Shrink-and-Expand" (trial_2_5) had a very low score, suggesting the implementation didn't actually optimize the radii effectively.
- Key Insight: The sum(radii) objective is sensitive. Small perturbations (shaking) are good for local refinement, but we need a more robust global search or a better way to handle the non-overlap constraints during 'jumps'.

## Generation 3 Strategy
- The current best (2.632342, trial_1_3) uses a 'shaking' mechanism (adding noise) followed by SLSQP refinement.
- Generation 2 failed to improve this significantly, likely due to implementation errors or insufficient exploration of the perturbation space.
- I will now focus on more structured perturbations: swapping circle positions and multi-scale refinement.
- I will also introduce a 'Force-Directed' initialization coupled with the successful SLSQP refinement.

## Generation 3 Analysis
- Best Gen 3 score: 2.630060 (trial_3_2), which is a regression from trial_1_3 (2.632342).
- The 'Multi-Scale Shaking' (trial_3_2) and 'Circle Swapping' (trial_3_0) were implemented but may have been limited by the 300s timeout or suboptimal hyperparameters (e.g., too many swaps, not enough SLSQP refinement per swap).
- Trial 3.3 (Voronoi) had a very low score (0.856), suggesting the local optimization within Voronoi cells is not a good proxy for the global sum-of-radii objective.
- Trial 3_5 failed due to an implementation error.

## Strategy for Gen 4
- Re-center on trial_1_3. It remains the most effective "engine".
- Instead of complex meta-heuristics, try improving the SLSQP step itself:
    - Use `jac` (Jacobian) for the constraints and objective to speed up convergence and improve precision.
    - Implement a "Staged Optimization": first optimize for a uniform radius (standard packing) to get a tight configuration, then switch to maximizing the sum of radii.
    - Try a "Grid-Search" on the shaking parameters (sigma and iteration count) to find the sweet spot for trial_1_3's logic.

## Generation 4 Strategy
- The primary goal is to break the 2.632 plateau.
- I am focusing on:
    1. Improving the 'engine' (trial_1_3) with analytical Jacobians.
    2. Decoupling centers and radii using Linear Programming (Basin-Hopping on centers).
    3. Two-stage optimization (Max-Min then Max-Sum).
    4. Heuristics like circle swapping and sequential addition.

## Generation 4 Analysis
- Best Gen 4 score: 2.627 (trial_4_0), still below trial_1_3 (2.632).
- The analytical Jacobian implementation in trial_4_0 is a good technical step but might need more 'shaking' iterations or a better perturbation schedule to find better optima.
- The LP approach (trial_4_1) is still underperforming, likely because the center movement is too decoupled from the radii growth in the outer loop.
- Strategy for Gen 5: Combine trial_1_3's robust exploration with trial_4_0's precision (Jacobians). Increase the search budget (more restarts/shaking) within the 300s limit.

## Gen 5 Analysis
### Analysis of Top-Performing Trials

The objective is to maximize $\sum r_i$ for $N=26$ circles in a unit square. This objective function differs significantly from the standard "packing" problem (maximizing a single uniform $r$). In this problem, the optimal solution usually involves a few large circles and many smaller ones filling the interstices.

#### Why Trial 1_3 Outperformed the Others
Trial 1_3 achieved the highest score (2.6323) because of its **two-phase hybrid approach**:

1.  **Phase 1 (Broad Exploration):** It spends the first 60 seconds performing multi-start SLSQP. This establishes a high-quality "global" layout.
2.  **Phase 2 (Iterative "Shake and Refine"):** Instead of starting from scratch (like Trial 0_0), it spends the remaining 225 seconds performing local stochastic searches.
3.  **Gap-Filling Logic:** Its `shake` function is more effective than Trial 3_2's because it focuses on **re-placing** circles into the **largest available gaps** found via sampling. This specifically targets the objective ($\sum r_i$) by trying to find spaces where a newly placed circle can grow larger than the one it replaced.
4.  **Vectorized Jacobian:** Both 1_3 and 0_0 use a precomputed, vectorized Jacobian for SLSQP. This makes each optimization step significantly faster than methods that rely on automatic differentiation or numerical gradients, allowing for more iterations within the time limit.

#### Weaknesses in the Current "Shaking" Strategy
While Trial 1_3 is effective, its shaking strategy has three main flaws:
1.  **Random Removal:** It selects circles to remove at random. In a $\sum r_i$ problem, the smallest circles are often "fillers." Removing a large circle might destroy a good configuration, whereas removing small circles allows the large ones to shift and expand.
2.  **Fixed Perturbation:** The perturbation (`np.random.normal(0, 0.001)`) is static. It doesn't adapt based on whether the search is stagnating.
3.  **Greedy Re-insertion:** It places circles one-by-one into gaps. It doesn't consider that moving *existing* circles slightly could create a much larger gap than any currently available.

---

### Proposed Improvement: "Targeted Thermal Shaking"

To improve the score, we can refine the `shake` strategy to be more surgical and adaptive.

#### 1. Targeted Removal (The "Smallest-First" Heuristic)
Instead of `random.choice(n, size=num_replace)`, we should prioritize removing circles with the **smallest radii**. These are the circles most likely to be trapped in sub-optimal local pockets. Removing them gives the larger circles "breathing room" to expand during the next SLSQP refinement.

#### 2. Adaptive Perturbation (Thermal Annealing)
Instead of a fixed `0.001` jitter, we can use a "temperature" that decreases over time. Early in Phase 2, we shake the centers vigorously; late in Phase 2, we perform very fine adjustments.

#### 3. LP-Refinement for Initialization
Before passing the "shaken" state to SLSQP, we can use **Linear Programming (LP)** to instantly find the optimal radii for the new center positions. This provides a much better starting point for the SLSQP solver than a fixed $r=0.02$.

### Improved `shake` Function Sketch

```python
def shake(current_vars, n, temperature):
    vars_copy = current_vars.copy()
    x, y, r = vars_copy[0::3], vars_copy[1::3], vars_copy[2::3]
    
    # 1. Targeted Removal: Remove 1-2 smallest circles and 1 random circle
    # This allows large circles to expand into the space of small ones.
    small_indices = np.argsort(r)[:np.random.randint(1, 3)]
    rand_indices = np.random.choice(n, size=1)
    indices_to_replace = np.unique(np.concatenate([small_indices, rand_indices]))
    
    # 2. Thermal Perturbation: Shake remaining circles
    # Magnitude depends on temperature (how much time is left)
    active_mask = np.ones(n, dtype=bool)
    active_mask[indices_to_replace] = False
    vars_copy[0::3][active_mask] += np.random.normal(0, 0.005 * temperature, np.sum(active_mask))
    vars_copy[1::3][active_mask] += np.random.normal(0, 0.005 * temperature, np.sum(active_mask))
    
    # 3. Gap Filling (Improved Sampling)
    # Use more samples (5000) for the targeted re-insertion
    for idx in indices_to_replace:
        samples = np.random.uniform(0, 1, (5000, 2))
        # ... (Distance calculations as in Trial 1_3)
        # Place circle at best_sample
        vars_copy[3*idx] = samples[best_sample_idx, 0]
        vars_copy[3*idx+1] = samples[best_sample_idx, 1]
        vars_copy[3*idx+2] = r_cand[best_sample_idx] # Better initial R
        
    return vars_copy
```

### Implementation Recommendation
To beat 2.6323, implement Phase 1 for only 40 seconds (to get a "good enough" base) and dedicate the rest of the time to this **Targeted Thermal Shaking**. The combination of removing small "filler" circles and using a cooling schedule for perturbations will allow the solver to push the large circles into more optimal packing arrangements.
## Generation 5 Breakthrough
- New Best Score: 2.635983084917561 (trial_5_0)
- Approach: Refined 'shaking' engine with analytical Jacobians and dynamic perturbation scaling.
- The precision of the Jacobian combined with the robust multi-start/shaking logic finally broke the 2.632 plateau.
- Trial 5_5 also performed well (2.623) using a two-pass SLSQP approach.

## Generation 6 Insight (Analysis of trial_5_0)
To bridge the $0.000002$ gap for $N=26$, we need to move from "finding a good configuration" to "mathematically perfecting the radii and tolerances." 

Trial 5_0 is nearly optimal, but it likely suffers from two issues:
1.  **Sub-optimal Radii for Fixed Centers:** The `fix_radii` heuristic is a greedy contraction. For any set of fixed centers $(x, y)$, the problem of maximizing $\sum r_i$ is a **Linear Programming (LP)** problem.
2.  **Solver Stagnation:** SLSQP can stall near the optimum if the constraints are slightly "soft."

### Key Algorithmic Tweaks

1.  **The LP Radii Refiner:** Replace the `fix_radii` heuristic with a formal LP solver (`scipy.optimize.linprog` with the `highs` method). For fixed centers, the constraints $r_i + r_j \leq \text{dist}(c_i, c_j)$ and boundary constraints are linear with respect to $r$.
2.  **Iterative Re-Centering:** After the LP solver maximizes radii for a set of centers, the "bottleneck" constraints (the ones where $r_i + r_j = \text{dist}_{ij}$) define a graph. We can use this to slightly nudge centers and re-run the LP.
3.  **Precision Scaling:** Use `ftol: 1e-12` and `eps: 1e-12` in the final Phase.
4.  **"Inflation" Shaking:** Instead of random replacement, use "Inflation." Shrink all radii by 1%, jitter the centers, and let SLSQP "re-inflate" them. This preserves the topology of a good packing while allowing the solver to find a better local gradient.

Here is the refined code designed to push for that final $0.000002$:

### Why this works:
1.  **Linear Programming (LP):** In circle packing for sum of radii, the "tightness" of the solution is often limited by the non-linear solver's ability to balance 26 different radii simultaneously. LP solves this exactly for a given set of centers.
2.  **Inflation vs. Replacement:** At a score of 2.635983, the "layout" (which circle is next to which) is almost certainly correct. Replacing circles (Trial 5_0's `shake`) is too disruptive. "Inflation" (shrinking and re-expanding) allows the centers to slide into more optimal positions within the same layout.
3.  **Constraint Jacobian:** The analytical Jacobian provided in Trial 5_0 is excellent; keeping it ensures the solver doesn't waste time estimating gradients.
4.  **The Final 0.000002:** This difference is often just the "slack" left by SLSQP's tolerance. The `get_lp_radii` function removes that slack entirely by pushing every circle until it hits a boundary or another circle.
## Generation 6 Analysis
- trial_6_0 failed (0.0), likely due to an error in the NonlinearConstraint implementation or the final return format.
- trial_6_2 and trial_6_1 regressed from trial_5_0. This suggests that the 'shaking' logic in 5_0 is very finely tuned, and the modifications (basin-hopping/LP) either didn't have enough time to converge or disrupted the delicate packing.
- The gap to the best known (2.635985) is only 0.000002. This is likely a matter of solver tolerance and the number of 'shaking' iterations.

## Generation 7 Strategy
- Target: Bridge the 0.000002 gap to 2.635985.
- Key Insight: trial_5_0's 'fix_radii' is suboptimal. Formal LP (linprog) should be used for the radii.
- Actions: Spawning children to integrate `linprog` into the trial_5_0 engine and increase solver precision.

## Gen 6 Post-Mortem Analysis
Trial 5_0 achieved a score of **2.635983**, which is remarkably close to the known optimal for 26 circles (the theoretical maximum for equal circles is lower, but for variable radii, this is a highly competitive density). 

The success of 5_0 compared to the regressions seen in Gen 6 (which attempted to incorporate Linear Programming and Basin-Hopping) can be attributed to three main factors: **gradient consistency**, **geometric "gap-filling" logic**, and **computational efficiency.**

### 1. The `fix_radii` Heuristic vs. Formal LP
In Gen 6, several attempts were made to use Linear Programming (LP) to solve for the optimal radii once the centers were fixed. While mathematically sound (maximizing $\sum r_i$ with fixed centers is a linear problem), it failed for several reasons:

*   **Gradient Discontinuity:** When you use an external LP solver to "reset" radii inside or between optimization loops, you break the "history" and gradient flow of the SLSQP solver. SLSQP expects the variables to evolve smoothly. 5_0 keeps $r$ as a decision variable within the SLSQP process, allowing the analytical Jacobian to guide both centers and radii simultaneously.
*   **The "Safety Net" Approach:** 5_0’s `fix_radii` is not used to *solve* the problem, but as a final post-processing safety check. It uses a simple iterative scaling (shrinking radii proportionally to satisfy overlaps). This is computationally negligible. Gen 6's LP approach often added overhead that reduced the total number of iterations possible within the 300s limit.
*   **LP Sensitivity:** LP solvers can sometimes push radii to zero for "crowded" circles to favor others, whereas the SLSQP approach in 5_0 tends to keep all circles "in the game," leading to better discovery of dense configurations.

### 2. The "Shake" Mechanism: Replacement vs. Jitter
Gen 6 trials relied heavily on SciPy’s `basinhopping`, which primarily uses Gaussian jitter (moving all points slightly). 5_0 uses a more sophisticated **Adaptive Shake-and-Refine** strategy:

*   **Targeted Re-placement:** If 5_0 gets stuck (no improvement), it doesn't just jitter; it **removes** 1–5 circles and uses a **Monte Carlo sampling (3,000 points)** to find the largest available "holes" in the current packing. 
*   **Why this beats Jitter:** In a tight packing, jittering usually results in immediate overlaps. The SLSQP solver then pushes the circles back to their original positions to satisfy constraints, effectively staying in the same local minimum. 5_0’s replacement strategy physically moves a circle to a new region of the search space, allowing for a genuine structural reconfiguration of the packing.
*   **Adaptive Sigma:** 5_0 scales its noise. It starts with small perturbations and only becomes more "aggressive" (higher sigma and more replacements) when it detects a plateau.

### 3. Solver Tolerances and Vectorization
Trial 5_0 is highly optimized for the 300-second window:

*   **Analytical Jacobians:** 5_0 uses fully vectorized NumPy operations to calculate the Jacobian of the overlap constraints ($n(n-1)/2$ constraints). This makes each SLSQP iteration extremely fast. Many Gen 6 attempts used automatic differentiation or slower loop-based Jacobian constructions.
*   **Multi-Phase Timing:** 
    *   **Phase 1 (40s):** Rapidly explores diverse starting points (Grid + Random).
    *   **Phase 2 (240s):** Deeply explores the best-found neighborhood using the shake-and-refine method.
    *   **Phase 3 (Final):** A "Final Polish" with a very tight tolerance (`1e-10`).
*   **The "Goldilocks" Tolerance:** Gen 6 often set tolerances too high (to save time) or too low (causing the solver to stall). 5_0 uses a graduated approach: `1e-7` for exploration, `1e-8` for refinement, and `1e-10` for the final result.

### Summary of Why Gen 6 Regressed
The Gen 6 trials suffered from **"Over-Engineering."** By adding complex dependencies like LP solvers or generic global optimizers (Basin-Hopping), they lost the ability to perform the high-frequency iterations that 5_0 performs. 

5_0 succeeds because it treats the problem as a **unified non-linear system** where centers and radii are optimized together, but it supplements this with a **geometric heuristic** (gap-filling) that understands the specific nature of circle packing better than a generic global optimizer does.
## Generation 7 Analysis
- Trial 7_3 matched trial_5_0's score (2.635983) but did not exceed it. 
- The 'Inflation' strategy in 7_3 is conceptually sound but might be limited by the precision of the SLSQP solver or the frequency of the LP refinement.
- Trial 7_2 failed due to a dimension mismatch in the LP constraints or objective.
- The gap to 2.635985 remains 0.000002. This is likely the 'numerical noise' floor of SLSQP.
- Strategy for Gen 8: Move away from SLSQP for the final polish. Use the LP solver to drive a 'Coordinate Descent' or 'Pattern Search' on the centers directly.

## Strategy for Generation 8
The goal is to move from 2.635983 to 2.635985. 
The post-mortem of Gen 7 suggests that LP-refinement 'jams' the SLSQP solver. 
Instead of interleaving LP and SLSQP, I will try:
1. **LP-Driven Coordinate Descent**: Use the centers from trial_5_0. For each circle, move its (x, y) slightly using a small grid or random search, and for EVERY move, re-calculate the optimal radii for ALL circles using LP. This makes the LP the actual objective function.
2. **Layout Preservation**: The layout in 5_0 is excellent. I will implement a 'Local Search' that only allows centers to move within a small radius of their current position, ensuring the topology doesn't break while the LP finds the optimal 'breathing' for the radii.
3. **Double-Precision Polish**: Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` with `method='L-BFGS-B'` or `COBYLA` on the center positions only, with a custom wrapper that calls `linprog` to get the sum of radii as the objective value.
