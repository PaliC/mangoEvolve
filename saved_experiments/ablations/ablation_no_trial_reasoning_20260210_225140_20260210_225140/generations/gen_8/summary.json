This is likely because the LP oracle creates a non-smooth objective landscape for the center-optimization, making it harder for standard solvers to converge quickly. I am carrying forward trial_5_0 as the primary lead, while keeping the best LP and Monte Carlo attempts for further refinement in the final generations.",
