SCRATCHPAD FOR GENERATION 0
============================================================


# Strategy for Generation 0
The goal is to maximize (min_dist / max_dist)^2 for 14 points in 3D.
This is scale-invariant, so we can optimize points within a unit sphere or cube.
Key approaches to explore:
1. Global search: Differential Evolution, Basin-Hopping, CMA-ES.
2. Local refinement: SLSQP/L-BFGS-B with smoothed objectives (SoftMin/LogSumExp).
3. Physical analogies: Repulsion models (Thomson problem style), force-directed layouts.
4. Geometric initializations: Spherical arrangements, lattices, perturbed polyhedra.

I will spawn a diverse set of 12 children to cover these strategies.
