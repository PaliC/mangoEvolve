Trial 17_2 provided a cleaner implementation of the 'manifold projection' step during global search, but the best scores still reside in earlier trials (8_0, 16_3) that used specific geometric seeds. For the next generation, we will combine the architectural cleanliness of 17_2 with the geometric insights of 16_3 and the symmetry constraints of 17_0.",
